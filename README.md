# Cookie Clicker Autobuyer

This mod will automatically buy the cheapest upgrade or building as you play. No need to think about buying anymore! The amount of buldings that can should be bought, is also configurable in the options menu!

>Beware: this has only been tested with the Steam Version and there is a large possibility that some things won't work in the Browser version, because lacking functionality

This does not turn off Steam Achievements as it only buys things you could just click yourself

### This Mod does not take discounts into account. So don't wonder why it doesn't buy some things instantly or buys things first that are a little more expensive
