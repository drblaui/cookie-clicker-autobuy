# Cookie Clicker Autobuyer

This mod will automatically buy the cheapest upgrade or building as you play. No need to think about buying anymore! The amount of buldings that can should be bought, is also configurable in the options menu!

>Beware: this has only been tested with the Steam Version and there is a large possibility that it won't work in the Browser version
## TODOS:
- Allow turning off buying upgrades
- Skip price check when bulk buying 0 buildings, so it doesn't always just buys zero buildings
