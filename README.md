# Cookie Clicker Autobuyer

This mod will automatically buy the cheapest upgrade or building as you play. No need to think about buying anymore! The amount of buldings that can should be bought, is also configurable in the options menu!

>Beware: this has only been tested with the Steam Version and there is a large possibility that some things won't work in the Browser version, because lacking functionality

This does not turn off Steam Achievements as it only buys things you could just click yourself

## Changelog

- 1.0: Initial Release
- 1.1 (09.01.2022): Updated how the Timeline is created so it won't slow down the game in the options menu. Also added options for not keeping track of timeline at all or clearing the current one
- 2.0 (17.02.2022): Basic overhaul
  - Small things are now a bit more efficient
  - Prices are now calculated like they are shown in game (this fixes a lot of issues and makes the whole mod more reliable)
  - the slider in the options now shows you the amount you are on **WHILE SLIDING**
  - Text in the next buy container will now stop clipping into the crate that show the icon
  - The timeline is now sorted the right way (it used to append wrong)
  - scrolling in the timeline is cached. This means that the scrollbar won't jump to the top when the menu redraws (which it does almost every tick)
- 2.1 (13.07.2022): Small changes
  - You can now turn off the notifications thanks to an idea from [Cheevo Dust](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2709341364) on steam.
  - Fixed a margin number that made the menu smaller since the newest game update
